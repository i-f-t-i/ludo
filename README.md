Ludo Game Project - How to Run

This document explains how to set up and run the Ludo game project. Please note that this project is currently a work in progress.

Project Files and Languages Used:

The Ludo game is built using standard web development languages:
HTML (index.html): Defines the structure of the game page.
CSS (style.css): Styles the visual appearance of the board, pieces, controls, etc.
JavaScript (script.js): Contains all the game logic, turn management, movement rules, etc.

How to Run the Project:

To run the game on your computer, follow these steps:
Create a new folder on your computer.
Inside this folder, create three new plain text files:
index.html
style.css
script.js
Copy the complete code provided for each of these files into the corresponding empty text files you just created.
Save all three files in the same folder.
Open the index.html file in your web browser (double-click it or drag it into the browser window).

Other Important Information:

Work in Progress: This is an ongoing project. Core Ludo rules are implemented, but you may encounter bugs or limitations.
Players: The game is designed for 4 human players taking turns on the same computer. There is no AI or multiplayer support.
Rules: Includes standard rules like moving pieces out with a 6, moving according to the dice roll, landing on safe squares (stars and start squares), capturing opponent pieces (on non-safe, non-blocked squares), and getting pieces home.
Special Squares: The board includes visually distinct stars (safe squares from capture) and specific squares that are implemented as places pieces cannot land on, based on the reference image provided.
Debugging: If you encounter issues, open your browser's developer console (usually F12) to check for error messages or game state logs.
